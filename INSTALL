INSTALLATION
	Make a symbolic link to tgraph.py
	(ln -s ~/tgraph/tgraph.py ~/bin/tgraph.py). Or copy both tgraph.py
	and tdata.py into the same directory (e.g. ~/bin) and make tgraph.py
	executable (chmod a+x tgraph.py). For the help menu to work,
	tgraph.txt should also be in this same directory.

	Since tgraph.py is written in python, you also need to install python,
	plus the python packages tkinter, tkinter.ttk, matplotlib and numpy.
	To get all these on a Debian system, it should suffice to type:
		apt-get install python-matplotlib

	tgraph.py was written for python3, but it will also run
	with python2, only the terminal output will be uglier due to
	differences in the print function between python versions.
