INSTALLATION
	Copy both tgraph.py and tdata.py into the same directory
	(e.g. ~/bin) and make tgraph.py executable (chmod a+x tgraph.py).

	Since tgraph.py is written in python, you also need to install python,
	plus the python packages tkinter, tkinter.ttk, matplotlib and numpy.
	To get all these on a Debian system, it should suffice to type:
		apt-get install python-matplotlib

	tgraph.py was written for python3, but it will also run
	with python2, only the terminal output will be uglier due to
	differences in the print function between python versions.
