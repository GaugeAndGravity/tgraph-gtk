INSTALLATION
	Copy both tgraph.py and tdata.py into the same directory and make 
	tgraph.py executable. 

	Since tgraph.py is written in python, you also need to install
	python, as well the python packages tkinter, tkinter.ttk, matplotlib
	and numpy. tgraph.py was written for python3, but it will also run
	with python2, only the terminal output will be uglier due to
	differences in the print function between python versions.
