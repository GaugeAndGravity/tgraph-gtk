tgraph.py - plot 1D and 2D data files
=====================================

This is a GTK port of ![tgraph](https://github.com/wofti/tgraph). The original script is using TK, which will not work with Wayland, and looks bad on HiDPi monitors. This working in progress GTK3 port will solve that, because GTK widgets:
- automatically works natively with either Xorg or Wayland,
- automatically follows your global HiDPi setting,
- and fits your global desktop GTK theme.

Installation:
-------------
For installation see the file INSTALL.


Help:
-----
More help and documentation is in the file tgraph.txt.


Plotting examples:
------------------
Example to plot columns 1,2 of a text data file in ygraph format:
tgraph.py -c 1:2 example-data/psi.X0

Example to plot columns 1,2,4 of vtk data files:
tgraph.py -c 1:2:4 [ example-data/rho_*.vtk ]


The data file examples are in the directory called example-data. There is:

Example with 1D data in ygraph format:
psi.X0

Example with 2D data in format suitable for gnuplot's splot:
psi.XY0

Examples with 2D data in legacy VTK format of type STRUCTURED_POINTS:
rho_0862.vtk
rho_0942.vtk
